        Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting internet-connected systems
        such as hardware, software and data from cyberthreats. It's used by
        individuals and enterprises to protect against unauthorized access to
        data centers and other computerized systems. An effective cybersecurity
        strategy can provide a strong security posture against malicious attacks
        designed to access, alter, delete, destroy or extort an organization's
        or user's systems and sensitive data. Cybersecurity is also instrumental
        in preventing attacks designed to disable or disrupt a system's or
        device's operations. An ideal cybersecurity approach should have
        multiple layers of protection across any potential access point or
        attack surface. This includes a protective layer for data, software,
        hardware and connected networks. In addition, all employees within an
        organization who have access to any of these endpoints should be trained
        on the proper compliance and security processes. Organizations also use
        tools such as unified threat management systems as another layer of
        protection against threats. These tools can detect, isolate and
        remediate potential threats and notify users if additional action is
        needed.Automation has become an integral component to keeping companies
        protected from the increasing number and sophistication of cyberthreats.
        Using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in areas with
        high-volume data streams can help improve cybersecurity in the following
        three main categories: Threat detection. AI platforms can analyze data
        and recognize known threats, as well as predict novel threats that use
        newly discovered attack techniques that bypass traditional security.
        Threat response. AI platforms create and automatically enact security
        protections. Human augmentation. Security pros are often overloaded with
        alerts and repetitive tasks. AI can help eliminate alert fatigue by
        automatically triaging low-risk alarms and automating big data analysis
        and other repetitive tasks, freeing humans for more sophisticated tasks.
        Other benefits of automation in cybersecurity include attack
        classification, malware classification, traffic analysis, compliance
        analysis and more.A vulnerability refers to a flaw in the structure,
        execution, functioning, or internal oversight of a computer or system
        that compromises its security. Most of the vulnerabilities that have
        been discovered are documented in the Common Vulnerabilities and
        Exposures (CVE) database.[6] An exploitable vulnerability is one for
        which at least one working attack or exploit exists.[7] Vulnerabilities
        can be researched, reverse-engineered, hunted, or exploited using
        automated tools or customized scripts.[8][9] Various people or parties
        are vulnerable to cyber attacks; however, different groups are likely to
        experience different types of attacks more than others.[10] In April
        2023, the United Kingdom Department for Science, Innovation & Technology
        released a report on cyber attacks over the last 12 months.[11] They
        surveyed 2,263 UK businesses, 1,174 UK registered charities, and 554
        education institutions. The research found that "32% of businesses and
        24% of charities overall recall any breaches or attacks from the last 12
        months." These figures were much higher for "medium businesses (59%),
        large businesses (69%), and high-income charities with Â£500,000 or more
        in annual income (56%)."[11] Yet, although medium or large businesses
        are more often the victims, since larger companies have generally
        improved their security over the last decade, small and midsize
        businesses (SMBs) have also become increasingly vulnerable as they often
        "do not have advanced tools to defend the business."[10] SMBs are most
        likely to be affected by malware, ransomware, phishing,
        man-in-the-middle attacks, and Denial-of Service (DoS) Attacks.[10]
        Normal internet users are most likely to be affected by untargeted.
